I have more than 15 years of professional experience in community and
public health in humanitarian crises and developing country-settings,
including as a community health worker, medical doctor, and recently as
specialised expert and head of metrics, analytics and technology for
[Valid International](https://www.validinternational.org). I have
expertise in spatial epidemiology, geo-statistics, and statistical
programming using [R](https://cran.r-project.org). In my recent role as
Head of Measures for [Valid
International](https://www.validinternational.org), I led the design,
development and implementation of innovative surveys and assessments on
health and nutrition and bespoke analytical approaches that leverage the
advantages of Bayesian statistics and resampling techniques.

I am a founding member of [Katilingban](https://katilingban.io), a
collective of public health and nutrition experts and practitioners
leading the development and implementation of the strategic direction of
the collective and heading its analytics and software development
services unit. I am currently part of the Oxford COVID-19 Modelling
Consortium (CoMo Consortium) Philippines team or
[CoMo-PH](https://como-ph.github.io) which aims to test and compare the
CoMo Consortium model with existing local models that have previously
been developed.
